[![Download](https://img.shields.io/badge/Download%20Now-Release%20Page-brightgreen)](https://github.com/RajAbbas/NeuroMind_AI-Alzheimer-Disease-Risk-Detection/releases)

## 📖 Overview

NeuroMind combines advanced AI techniques to assess Alzheimer’s disease risk. It integrates various data sources, including:

- **CSF Proteomics**: Analyzes proteins in cerebrospinal fluid.
- **MRI Volumetrics**: Assesses brain structure from MRI scans.
- **Genetic Information**: Evaluates genetic risk factors.

The result is an accurate XGBoost model that achieves 88% AUC. Additionally, it includes an LLM-powered "AI Neurologist" for interpreting results.
