**NeuroMind AI** is a clinical decision support system designed to bridge the gap between complex biological data and actionable medical insights. It predicts the risk of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) by fusing three distinct data modalities:
1.  **Proteomics:** Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) biomarkers (Amyloid Beta, Tau).
2.  **Neuroimaging:** MRI volumetrics (Hippocampus, Ventricles).
3.  **Genetics:** APOE4 allele status.

It goes beyond simple prediction by integrating a **Generative AI Doctor** (Google Gemini) to explain the *biology* behind the risk score in plain English.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. The "Neurotoxic Ratio" Engine
Raw protein levels can be misleading. I engineered a custom feature, the **Neurotoxic Ratio** (`pTau / Abeta`), which quantifies the imbalance between neuronal damage (Tau) and plaque clearance (Amyloid). 
* **Result:** This engineered feature proved to be a stronger predictor than raw protein levels alone, increasing model accuracy.

### 2. Multimodal Fusion
The model doesn't look at just one factor. It learns non-linear interactions, such as:
* *"High Tau is bad, but High Tau + Shrinking Hippocampus + APOE4 Gene is catastrophic."*

### 3. The AI Neurologist (LLM Integration)
Instead of just giving a probability ("85% Risk"), the app uses **Google Gemini 2.5 Flash** to generate a clinical narrative:
> *"Patient shows a critical imbalance in the Neurotoxic Ratio (0.08), suggesting active pathology. However, Hippocampal volume is preserved, indicating early-stage disease with cognitive reserve."*

## 📊 Model Performance
Trained on the **TADPOLE (ADNI)** dataset, a gold-standard longitudinal study.

| Metric | Score | Interpretation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Accuracy** | **80.65%** | Strong predictive power on unseen patients |
| **ROC-AUC** | **0.88** | Excellent discrimination between Healthy vs. At-Risk |
| **Recall (Sick)** | **0.86** | Misses very few actual cases (High Sensitivity) |

### **Explainability (SHAP)**

*The model confirms that **Neurotoxic Ratio** and **Hippocampus Volume** are the top drivers of risk, validating the biological hypothesis.*
